The following is a recreation from memory

The party discovers the local adventurers guild and starts taking odd jobs around the city

[[Parties/Tales From Martere/Leela Wolfris|Leela]] finishes reading her book which earns her a level up before everyone else(?)

[[Parties/Tales From Martere/Bealin Genrie|Bealin]] on a solo quest to pick berries meet a couple of emissaries from the country of Paloro outside of the city they offer him food and they get along

The Palorans follow [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Bealin Genrie|Bealin]] back to meet the rest of the party and everyone gets a paloran sandwich

[[Parties/Tales From Martere/Renna Genrie|Renna]] makes a ~~devil~~ deal that forces the party back to the wrecked ship in order to recover "The Blue Sapphire" (and a sending stone)

The party works on the ship and run out of nails... [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Jhaan Wolfris|Jhaan]] volunteer to go back into town in order to buy some nails from a smith...

Meanwhile [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Dwargon Dragongrog|Dwargon]], [[Parties/Tales From Martere/The Duck|Anas]], [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Leela Wolfris|Leela]] and [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Thorin Ironfist|Thorin]] sneak aboard the Armada's ship in order to recover the sending stone

[[Parties/Tales From Martere/Dwargon Dragongrog|Dwargon]] and [[Parties/Tales From Martere/The Duck|Anas]] are caught and thrown into a "Prison Tent" under constant guard

The Armada ship is now under constant surveillance by the foreman's men trapping [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Leela Wolfris|Leela]] and [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Thorin Ironfist|Thorin]] inside

And [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Jhaan Wolfris|Jhaan]] arrives back just in time to meet up with [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Bealin Genrie|Bealin]] and [[Parties/Tales From Martere/Renna Genrie|Renna Genrie]]

The party is therefore now split up
